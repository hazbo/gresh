Gresh is a cli tool to manage Leyra. This is being activly developed along side
with Leyra. So far only very basic functions are available. I'll update this
README as I go.

Usage:

$ gresh new my_app

will create a new clean copy of Leyra. A local GOPATH is currently needed to
build Leyra. Instructions are shown upon running the above command.

$ gresh fetch leyra/blog

will pull down the code from github.com/leyra/blog. Currently this does not use
git to do so.

$ gresh configure

will configure the current Leyra application. Currently this doesn't produce any
files, but will the function that generates files from the stub files in Leyra.
